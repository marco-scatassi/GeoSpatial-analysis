# Emergency Facility Location Problem
This project aims to solve the **Emergency Facility Location Problem** using both **deterministic** and **stochastic** methods to evaluate the impact of uncertainty on the solution. The project uses data collected from the **HERE map API** (https://www.here.com/), specifically focusing on traffic data in **Bergen**.

The project is organized in a modular and reproducible way using the **Kedro** framework (https://kedro.org/). Kedro provides a standard project structure, allowing for easy navigation and understanding of the project's components.
