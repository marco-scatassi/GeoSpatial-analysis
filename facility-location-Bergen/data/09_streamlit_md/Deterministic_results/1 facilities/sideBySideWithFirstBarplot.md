The main question leading the analysis is: **Does stochasticity matter?**. Therefore, the next step brings us to analyse what would happen whether the naive solution, obtainable solving the facility location problem in the ideal free flow scenario, was used against every possible scenario.

The barplot on the left compare the value of the objective function obtainable when the selected location is, from left to right, the optimal under a fixed scenario, the “free flow” location under the same scenario, the “free flow” location under the worst case for the fixed scenario.
