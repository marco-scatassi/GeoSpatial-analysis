A precise analysis can be made, looking at the relative differences between the objective function values shown in the previous figure.

Specifically, the maximum time required to reach the farthest demand point (i.e. the objective function) increase the most in the **morning** and **midday** scenarios. While in the **all day** and **afternoon** scenarios, the relative difference is not particularly high. 

Instead, looking at the **average worst scenarios**, we can observe a significant increase in each scenario that is **minimum** and equal to 17% for the **all day** scenario, **maximum** and equal to 24.5% for the **morning** scenario.

These data underline how not taking into account stochasticity, potentially lead to face situations in which the time required to reach the demand point is up to 5/6 minutes longer than the one expected.
