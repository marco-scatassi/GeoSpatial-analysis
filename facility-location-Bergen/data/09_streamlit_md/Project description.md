# Website Project Description

## Project Overview
The website project is a Streamlit application designed to share the results of my master's thesis in data science. The topic of the thesis revolves around finding a solution to a facility location problem for emergency facilities in the city of Bergen. The main objective of the project is to investigate the impact of stochasticity, particularly the uncertainty related to traffic congestion, on the facility location problem.

## Goals
The primary goal of the website is to present the findings and results of the research conducted for the master's thesis. Specifically, it aims to verify whether stochasticity matters in the context of the facility location problem. To achieve this, both the deterministic and two-stage programming versions of the problem have been solved and compared.

## Functionality
The website will provide the following functionalities:
- **Result Visualization:** Display interactive visualizations of the facility location problem results, including maps, charts, and statistical analysis.
- **Comparison:** Enable users to compare the results between the deterministic and two-stage programming approaches, showcasing the impact of stochasticity.
- **Mathematical Formulation:** Include sections where the mathematical formulation of the problem is explained in detail, covering both the deterministic and stochastic versions.

## Target Audience
The website is primarily targeted towards researchers, academics, and professionals in the field of data science, optimization, and emergency management. The content will be presented in a way that is accessible to individuals with a basic understanding of optimization and mathematical modeling.

## Deliverables
The following deliverables are expected for the completion of the website project:
- A fully functional Streamlit application deployed on a web server.
- Interactive visualizations of the facility location problem results.
- Detailed explanations of the mathematical formulation for both the deterministic and stochastic versions of the problem.

## Technologies Used
The website will be developed using the following technologies:
- Streamlit framework for building the interactive application.
- Python programming language for data analysis, visualization, and backend development.

## Conclusion
The website project aims to provide an accessible platform to share the findings of the master's thesis on the facility location problem for emergency facilities in Bergen. By showcasing the impact of stochasticity and traffic congestion uncertainty, it will contribute to the field of optimization and aid decision-makers in emergency management.
