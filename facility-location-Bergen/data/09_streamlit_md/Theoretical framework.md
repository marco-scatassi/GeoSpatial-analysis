# Theoretical framework

## Introduction
In this section, we provide a general description of the emergency facility problem and discuss the reasons why such facilities are crucial. 

An emergency is “something dangerous or serious, such as an accident, that happens suddenly or unexpectedly and needs fast action in order to avoid harmful results” (https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/emergency). The practice of dealing with emergency situations goes under the name of *emergency management*, and it includes a 4-phase cycle [1] :
1. mitigation;
2. preparedness;
3. response;
4. recovery.

Evidently, a zero step can be included: *prevention*.

In this general framework, the issue of selecting the number and the locations of emergency facilities lies both in the *mitigation* and *response* phases especially, when the uncertainty is considered. Indeed, In the context of mitigation, it involves determining the placement of facilities to minimize the detrimental effects of unavoidable emergencies (where should we place the facilities?). On the other hand, the *response* phase regards every course of actions undertaken after the occurrence of an emergency (which demanding point is associate to which serving point?).
